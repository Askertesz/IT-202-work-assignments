    <h3>What I've been up to:</h3>
    <!--Add a headshot here?-->
    <p>Student studying IT at NJIT: <br>I Graduated from The County College of Morris in May 2024 with an associates degree in Information Technology, and spent another year at my part time position at an MSP startup called <strong>Navatechs</strong>. After realizing that the growth of the company would not be compatable with me holding a full time position there, I continued my education at NJIT studying Information Technology in September 2025.</p>
